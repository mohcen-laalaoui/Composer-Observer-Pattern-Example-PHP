//? In this code:
//todo - The Notifier class is part of the 'app' namespace.
//todo - It implements the Observe interface, which means it provides an implementation for the handl() method declared in the interface.
//todo - The handl() method is responsible for handling the notification when the email changes.
//todo - In this specific implementation, it uses var_dump to output a debug message indicating that the email has been changed successfully.
//todo - This class is designed to be an observer, and its handl() method will be called when it is attached to a subject (e.g., a User) that undergoes a relevant change.
//todo - Make sure that the Observe interface is correctly defined, and the class file is located according to your PSR-4 autoloading configuration if you are using Composer.
