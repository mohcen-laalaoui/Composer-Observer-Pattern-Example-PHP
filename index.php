// In this code:
// - The Composer autoloader is required to automatically load classes according to your PSR-4 autoloading configuration.
// - The file "pattern.php" is required, which presumably contains the implementation of your observer pattern (classes like User, Notifier, Logger, and interfaces like Subject and Observe).
// - The code that creates a User object, attaches observers, and changes the email is commented out. Uncomment and execute this code to see the observer pattern in action.
// - Make sure the paths in the require statements are correct and match your project structure.
